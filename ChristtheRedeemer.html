    <b><h2>Christ The Redeemer Statue</h2></b>
    <p>Christ the Redeemer is a giant Jesus Christ statue, towering 98 feet or 30 metres tall. Horizontally, the arm spanning is 92 feet or 28 metres. Christ the Redeemer stands at the summit of Mount Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil. It is the most massive Art deco sculpture in the world. However, during a storm in 2014, it was hit with lightning, and Jesus’s right thumb was damaged. </p>

    <u><h3>When Was It Built?</u></h3>
    <P>It was built just after World War 1, where some Brazilians feared a “tide of godlessness. “They proposed a statue. Christ the Redeemer was designed by Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul Landowski. The building started in 1926, and after five years, it was finished.  </P>

    <u><h3>Why on Mount Corcovado?</u></h3>
    <P>In the 1850s, the Vincentian priest Pedro Maria Boss suggested putting a Christian monument on Mount Corcovado to honor a princess regent of Brazil and the daughter of Emperor Pedro the second, Isabel. However, the project was never approved. In 1921, the Roman Catholic archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro suggested building a statue of Christ on the Mount. They wanted it on Mount Corcovado so that it would be visible from anywhere in Rio. Pres. Epitácio Pessoa approved of this statue.</P>

    <u><h3>How Was It Built?</u></h3>
    <P>Christ the Redeemer is made of reinforced concrete and is covered in approximately six million tiles. Once permission was granted, the foundation stone of the base was laid on April 04, 1922. Later that same year, a competition was held to find a designer for the statue. Heitor da Silva Costa was chosen on the basis of his sketches. His sketches were of a figure of Christ holding a cross in his right hand and the world in his left. However, he dropped that idea in collaboration with a Brazilian artist Carolos Oswald and Silva Costa. Oswald has been credited with the idea for the figure’s standing pose with arms spread wide. A French sculptor, Paul Landowski, helped with the final design. Landowski was credited as the primary designer of the figure’s head and hands. The costs of the statue were raised privately, but they had the help of a church. The cost of the project was $250,000 back in 1926; in 2020, it now costs about $3.4 million.</P>
