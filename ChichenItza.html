    <b><h2>Chichen Itza</h2></b>
    <P>Chichen Itza was a Mayan city on the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. Chichen Itza provides us the culture and accomplishments of the Mayan people. The name Chichen Itza is a Mayan language term for “at the mouth of the well of the Itza.” The Itza were an ethnic group of Mayans. They had risen to power in the northern part of the Yucatan peninsula, where the city is located. Chichen Itza was built around 415 to 455 AD. </P>

    <u><h3>Where was It Made?</u></h3>
    <P>Chichen Itza was built in an area of rough terrain that was leveled in order to support more substantial structures, like El Castillo. Chichen Itza is located about 120 miles from the modern-day resort town of Cancun, on Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. Underneath were several underground rivers; this serves as the water source of Chichen Itza. And it makes a perfect location for a city.  </P>

    <u><h3>The Importance of Chichen-Itza</u></h3>
    <P>Chichen-Itza provides us the culture and accomplishments of the Mayan people. The second settlement of Chichen-Itza is the most important for historians because it corresponds to the migration of Toltec warriors from the Mexican plateau.  </P>
   
    <u><h3>The Buildings Of Chichen-Itza</u></h3>
    <P>The Mayan were much more advanced than other civilizations. All of the buildings of Chichen Itza were linked by a network of nearly 100 “sacbeob,” or paved roadways and sidewalks. The closed roads were significant because many European cities did not yet have paved streets. The earliest structures are to the south of the central Plaza. They include: the Akab Dzib (House of the Dark Writing), the Iglesia (church), the Casa de las Monjas (Nunnery), and the observatory El Caracol (The Snail). There is evidence that, in the 10th century, after the collapse of the Maya cities of the southern lowlands, Chichen was invaded by foreigners. These invaders were responsible for the construction of such significant buildings as El Castillo. It is a pyramid that rises 79 feet (24 metres) above the Main Plaza. </P>
