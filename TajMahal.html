    <b><h2>Taj Mahal</h2></b>
    <P>The Taj Mahal, a mausoleum complex, located in Agram India is known as one of the worldâ€™s most iconic monuments and is perhaps the most beautiful example of Mughal architecture. It was built by Emperor Shah Jahan in 1632, to honor his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The construction started in 1632 AD and was completed in 1648 Ad, taking 16 years to build. </P>

    <u><h3>The Immense Architecture Perfection of The Taj Mahal</u></h3>
    <P>The mausoleum complex was influenced by Indian, Persian, and Islamic architecture. At its center is the Taj Mahal itself, built of shimmering white marble that can change color depending on the daylight. For its construction, masons, stone-cutters, in layers, carver, painters, calligraphers, dome builders, and other artisans were requisitioned from the empire and Central Asia and Iran. More than 20,000 workers were employed. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the leading architect of the Taj Mahal. Taj Mahal is a perfect symmetrical planned building. The building material used is the brick-in-lime mortar with red sandstone and marble and inlay work of precious/semi-precious stones. Taj Mahal represents the most magnificent architectural and artistic achievement through perfect harmony and excellent craftsmanship in a whole range of Indo-Islamic sepulchral architecture. It is a masterpiece of architectural style in conception, treatment, and execution. It has unique aesthetic qualities in balance, symmetry, and harmonious blending of various elements. </P>
