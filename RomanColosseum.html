    <b><h2>The Roman Colosseum</h2></b>
    <P>The Roman Colosseum was built in the first century by order of Emperor Vespasian as a gift to the Roman people. The Colosseum is capable of holding 50,000 spectators. According to some estimates, about 500,000 people died in the Colosseum. Additionally, so many animals were captured and then killed there that a particular species reportedly became extinct. </P>

    <u><h3>The Joy of Death Games</u></h3>
    <P>The Colosseum was a place to watch many events. The most notable events were the gladiator fights. Men battling animals was also common. Water was sometimes pumped into the Colosseum for mock naval engagements.</P>

    <u><h3>How was It Built?</u></h3>
    <P>Measuring some 620 by 513 feet, or 190 by 155 meters, the Colosseum was the largest amphitheater in the Roman world. Unlike many earlier amphitheaters, usually dug into hillsides to provide adequate support, the Colosseum was a freestanding structure made of stone and concrete. It has three stores of arched entrances.  </P>

    <u><h3>The Damages of The Colosseum</u></h3>
    <P>The Colosseum was damaged by lightning and earthquakes in medieval times and, even more severely, by vandalism. All the marble seats and decorative material disappeared. The site was treated as little more than a quarry for more than 1,000 years. The restoration project began in the 1990s by Pius ⅤⅢ.
