    <b><h2>Machu Picchu</h2></b>
    <p>This Incan civilization, located near Cuzco, Peru, was discovered in 1911 by Hiram Bingham. At first, Bingham thought it was Vilcabamba, a secret Incan stronghold used during the 16th-century rebellion against Spanish rule. Machu Picchu has about 200 structures for the religious, ceremonial, astronomical, and agricultural activities they did. The city is divided into a lower and upper part, separating the farming from the residential areas.</p>

    <u><h3>The Secrets of an Unknown Land</u></h3>
    <P>Scholars have come up with many other ideas on what this civilization serves as: perhaps for confounded scholars, home to women who live in convents under a vow of chastity, a pilgrimage site, or a royal retreat. Despite all these theories, none of them was proved correct.</P>
    <u><h3>The Mountain Life</u></h3>
    <P>It was built in the rocky countryside of Cuzo, Peru. It was in the middle of a tropical mountain forest on the Andes Mountains. Machu Picchuâ€™s Wall, terraces, stairways, and ramps blend seamlessly into its natural setting. Its settings are frequent to earthquakes, yet Machu Picchu has been standing strong for thousands of years. It was built more than 2,400 meters above sea level and covers 32,592 hectares of land.</P>

    <u><h3>The Stones of Earth Shall Withstand the Earth</u></h3>
    <P>Stone was used to building Machu Picchu; these stones used no mortar. They were cut so precisely, and wedged so closely together, that a credit card cannot be inserted between them. When an earthquake occurs, the stones start to dance upon themselves, then simply fall back. The Inca was incredibly advanced for a civilization that used no draft animals, iron tools, or wheels. Yet, scholars have wondered how the Inca could build from such a high ground and withstand earthquakes. The answer is an underground building. The engineer Kenneth Wright has estimated that 60% of the construction done at Machu Picchu was underground. The underground is made up of deep building foundation and crushed rock used as drainage. This drainage is especially important because the rainy season is harsh around Machu Picchu.</P>
