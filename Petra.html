    <b><h2>Petra</h2></b>
    <P>Petra is an ancient city, and it is the center of an Arab kingdom in Hellenistic and Roman times. The ruins of which are in southwest Jordan. The town was built on a terrace. Petra is half-built, half-carved into the rock, and is surrounded by mountains riddled with passages and gorges. It is one of the worldâ€™s most famous archaeological sites. It is where ancient Eastern traditions blend with Hellenistic architecture.</P>

    <u><h3>Living in a Rock</u></h3>
    <P>Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, occupied the land of Petra and made it the capital of their kingdom. In 312 BCE, the region was attacked by Seleucid Forces, but they failed to seize the city. Under the Nabataean rule, Petra prospered as the center of the spice trade. The population was around 10,000 to 30,000. Then in 106 CE, the Romans attacked and was able to capture Petra, making it a part of the Roman province. Two significant earthquakes hit Petra and made life harder in Petra, resulting in it being abandoned. One earthquake happened in 363 CE and the other in 551.</P>

    <u><h3>Carving The City Set in Stone</u></h3>
    <P>Not much is known about Petra, like how it was built. However, there is evidence that they used the techniques of quarrying and rock cutting. However, it is truly unknown. </P>

    <u><h3>The Irony of Water Management in Petra</u></h3>
    <P>Petra has an ingenious water management system that allows extensive settlement within a dry area. There are the remnants of the diversion dam, Muslim tunnel, water channels, aqueducts, reservoirs, and cisterns. The rainy season of the Petra only comes for a few days, and the rest of the year is dry. So the Nabataeans decided to make a water reserve to store the rainwater. They are often pools of water and tunnels running through the city.</P>
